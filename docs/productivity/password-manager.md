# Password Manager

For now I'll use 1Password as my password manager.

Limitations:

1. Passwords are stored in remote servers
2. Not open source. They can make changes which you don't like in the future
3. The cli cannot access passwords in offline mode (in development hopefully)

Try to move to Keepass in the future, when I have my own private cloud set up.
