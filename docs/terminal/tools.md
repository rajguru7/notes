### Tool info

#### Vim

As checked while using mkdocs, mkdocs watches the directory for any changes and performs a new build.
In Vim, there are backup files that are created while editing.
These backup files end with '.md~' by default.
While writing vim writes the updates to the files in the backup file and then deletes the original file and then renames the backup file to the original file [[1]][ext1].
This step results in error in mkdocs because the orginal file is getting deleted which is then not found in mkdocs.
To resolve this, I have set backupcopy to "yes" for md files which creates the backup file but the edits happen to original file and then the backup file is removed. Refer ":help backup" in vim.
